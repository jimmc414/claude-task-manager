[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A fast, local CLI that integrates seamlessly with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Manage tasks through natural language, spawn AI sessions in project directories, track team workloads, and keep your development workflow in sync.

## Why claude-task-manager?

- **Claude-first design** - Built for developers using Claude Code as their primary development tool
- **Natural language** - Just talk: "Add a high priority task to fix the login bug by Friday"
- **Multi-tenant** - Track tasks for yourself and your team with users and namespaces
- **Project-aware sessions** - `/work 3` opens Claude in the task's project directory with full context
- **GitHub integration** - Create tasks from issues, close issues when completing tasks
- **Team reporting** - Workload analysis, completion stats, and team dashboards
- **Fast & local** - <2MB binary, <10ms response, SQLite storage
- **No cloud dependencies** - Your tasks stay on your machine

## Installation

```bash
# From crates.io
cargo install claude-task-manager

# The CLI command is 'ctm'
ctm task "My first task" today
```

## Quick Start with Claude Code

Once installed, use these commands directly in Claude Code:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/today` | Show today's tasks and anything overdue |
| `/tasks` | Overview of open tasks |
| `/task fix bug friday -P high` | Add high priority task |
| `/done 1` | Mark task complete |
| `/work 3` | Open Claude in task's project with context |
| `/standup` | Generate daily standup report |

Or just talk naturally:
- "What do I need to do today?"
- "Add a high priority task to review the PR by tomorrow"
- "Show me Sarah's workload"
- "Mark the first task done"
- "Create a task from issue owner/repo#42"

## Claude Code Integration

This project includes comprehensive Claude Code integration with agents, slash commands, hooks, and context skills. All integrations are **project-scoped** (stored in `.claude/`) and only active when working in this project.

### Agents

Agents are automatically invoked based on conversation context.

| Agent | File | Purpose | Triggers |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| **ctm** | `.claude/agents/ctm.md` | Task management via natural language | "tasks", "todo", "reminders", "deadline", "overdue" |
| **repo** | `.claude/agents/repo.md` | Development assistance for this codebase | "how does X work?", "where to add?", architecture questions |

**Examples:**
```
"What tasks do I have today?"          → ctm agent
"How do I add a new command?"          → repo agent
"Show me the team workload"            → ctm agent
"Where is the database code?"          → repo agent
```

### Slash Commands (16)

All commands are in `.claude/commands/`.

#### Core Task Commands
| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/today` | Today's tasks + overdue items | Quick daily view |
| `/tasks` | All open tasks | Full overview |
| `/task` | Quick add task | `/task review PR tomorrow -P high` |
| `/done` | Mark task complete | `/done 1 -c "fixed in PR #42"` |
| `/overdue` | Show overdue tasks | What needs attention |
| `/status` | Quick health check | Overdue count + priorities |

#### Task Details Commands
| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/show` | Detailed task view | `/show 3` - notes, links, history |
| `/note` | Add note to task | `/note 3 "found root cause"` |
| `/claim` | Claim unassigned task | `/claim 5` |

#### Project & Workflow Commands
| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/work` | Open Claude in project directory | `/work 3` - with full task context |
| `/standup` | Generate standup report | Yesterday/Today/Blockers format |
| `/reminders` | Full task summary | Daily overview |

#### Team & Reporting Commands
| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/team` | Team task distribution | Who has what tasks |
| `/workload` | Estimated hours per person | `/workload --user sarah` |
| `/stats` | Completion statistics | `/stats --days 7` |

#### Context Commands
| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/repo` | Re-inject project context | Use when Claude loses context |

### Hooks

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` and run automatically on events.

| Hook | Event | What it Does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **SessionStart** | Session start/resume | Shows overdue tasks and today's tasks |

**SessionStart Hook Output:**
```
📋 Task Overview
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  OVERDUE:
[list of overdue tasks]

📅 TODAY:
[list of tasks due today]
```

This runs automatically when you:
- Start a new Claude Code session in this project
- Resume an existing session
- After `/clear` or context compaction

### Context Persistence

Claude Code context can be lost during long sessions or compaction. This project addresses that with:

| Mechanism | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Auto-loaded at session start (may get summarized) |
| `/repo` command | On-demand context re-injection (survives compaction) |
| `repo` agent | Automatic for architecture questions |

**If Claude seems confused about the project, run `/repo` to refresh context.**

ctm user list
ctm user delete sarah

# Namespace management (organize by project/team)
ctm ns create backend -d "Backend team tasks"
ctm ns list
ctm ns switch backend            # Set as default
ctm ns add-user backend sarah --role admin
ctm ns members backend

# Work as a specific user or in a specific namespace
ctm --as sarah list task         # See sarah's view
ctm --ns backend task "Deploy API" friday
```

### Team Reporting

```bash
# Team task distribution
ctm team                         # Who has what tasks
ctm team --json                  # JSON output for integrations
ctm team --md                    # Markdown for documentation

# Workload analysis
ctm workload                     # Hours per person
ctm workload --user sarah        # Single user detail

# Task statistics
ctm stats                        # Last 30 days
ctm stats --days 7               # Last week
ctm stats --json                 # JSON output
```

### GitHub Integration

```bash
# Create task from GitHub issue
ctm task --from-issue owner/repo#42

# Complete task and close linked issue
ctm done 3 --close-issue

# Link existing task to GitHub
ctm link 3 --issue owner/repo#42
ctm link 3 --pr owner/repo#43
```

Requires the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) to be installed and authenticated.

### Project Integration

Link tasks to projects for seamless context switching:

```json
// ~/.config/ctm/config.json
{
  "terminal_profile": "Ubuntu",
  "projects": {
    "myapp": {
      "path": "/mnt/c/projects/myapp",
      "claude_flags": "--dangerously-skip-permissions"
    },
    "api": {
      "path": "/mnt/c/projects/api",
      "conda_env": "api-env"
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
# Add task with project
ctm task "Implement OAuth" friday -p myapp

# In Claude Code, open a session in the project directory
/work 1
```

The `/work` command spawns a new Claude Code session in the project's directory with:
- Task details (priority, estimate, due date)
- All notes and progress updates
- Linked commits, issues, and PRs
- Recent git activity (last 5 commits, open PRs/issues)

### Records

Track completed work and events:

```bash
ctm record "Deployed v2.1 to production"
ctm record -c meetings "Sprint planning - decided on Q1 priorities"
ctm list record -d 7    # Last 7 days
```

## Data Storage

- **Database**: `~/.local/share/ctm/ctm.db` (SQLite)
- **Config**: `~/.config/ctm/config.json` (optional)

### Database Schema

The database uses schema v5 with support for:
- Users and namespaces (multi-tenant)
- Task ownership and assignment
- Priority and time estimates
- Notes and links
- Audit logging

## Migration from tascli

If you're migrating from the original tascli:

```bash
# Move your database
mv ~/.local/share/tascli/tascli.db ~/.local/share/ctm/ctm.db

# Update config location
mv ~/.config/tascli/config.json ~/.config/ctm/config.json
```

The database schema is compatible and will auto-migrate.

| Status | Code | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| ongoing | 0 | In progress |
| done | 1 | Completed |
| cancelled | 2 | Cancelled |
| duplicate | 3 | Duplicate |
| suspended | 4 | On hold |
| pending | 6 | Not started |
| open | 254 | ongoing + pending + suspended |
| closed | 253 | done + cancelled + duplicate |
| all | 255 | All statuses |
